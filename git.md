# Git and Github

+ Difference between `clone` and `fork`
    - `clone` is a `git` command but `fork` is a concept.
    - cloned repository changes can merged into master ONLY if you have write permission or added as a contributor by the owner whereas forked repository is a complete copy of the original repository that copied to your account and you must request a `pull request` to the owner that ask him to merge changes you made.
